Measures of central tendency
The measures of central tendencies are given by various parameters but the most commonly used ones are mean, median and mode.
These parameters are discussed below.
What is Mean?
    Mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. 
    It actually represents the average of the given collection of data.
    It is applicable for both continuous and discrete data.

It is equal to the sum of all the values in the collection of data divided by the total number of values.

Suppose we have n values in a set of data namely as x1, x2, x3, …, xn, then the mean of data is given by:


 
What is Median?
Generally median represents the mid-value of the given set of data when arranged in a particular order.
Median: Given that the data collection is arranged in ascending or descending order, the following method is applied:
    If number of values or observations in the given data is odd, then the median is given by [(n+1)/2]th observation.
    If in the given data set, the number of values or observations is even, then the median is given by the average of (n/2)th  and  [(n/2) +1]th observation.

What is Mode?
The most frequent number occurring in the data set is known as the mode.
